## Leaderless Network

Leaderless Network is an EVM blockchain initially under PoA and will have its own beacon chain and will become PoS.

### Supply and Distribution 

100M initial token supply.
Top 3M richest Ethereum accounts will get 33 LLN each based on a snapshot at a future block height. Each of the 3M accounts will have enough to run a beacon chain validator. 1M LLN goes to founders. This means 99% of supply will be airdropped and 1% goes to the founders.

#### Roadmap

At the start, since it is a PoA chain, we will provide guidance on launching the beacon chain and coordinate the merge. Once it has fully switched to PoS, it will become fully decentralized and leaderless.
